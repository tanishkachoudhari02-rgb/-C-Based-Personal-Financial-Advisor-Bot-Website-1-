# Centsage implementation plan

## Product scope

Centsage is a privacy-first, educational personal finance advisor. It uses a small C HTTP server to render the page, calculate a monthly budget snapshot, and return rule-based savings/advisor responses. There is no login, database, bank connection, external finance API, or persistent storage. User inputs live only for the request and are not written to disk.

## Implementation approach

- `src/main.c` is a dependency-free C11 HTTP server listening on `0.0.0.0:3000` (or `PORT`). It serves the homepage, CSS, and two POST actions: `/api/plan` for the budget snapshot and `/api/advice` for conversational rule-based guidance.
- The server parses `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` form values, validates non-negative money inputs, calculates totals and rates with transparent helper functions, and HTML-escapes any user-provided text before rendering it back.
- The server also accepts `/api/track` with up to six expense rows. Each row can use an explicit lane or `auto`; the C rules engine checks selected categories first, then matches description keywords such as rent, grocery, phone, loan, and credit card into Essentials, Flexible, Debt, or Other. Results show category totals against the monthly lanes and remain request/session-only.
- `public/styles.css` provides the only presentation layer: a responsive, accessible, warm editorial dashboard with clear labels, visible focus states, high contrast, and mobile-friendly layout.
- `public/manus-routes.json` declares the single page route required by Webdev.
- `Makefile` builds the C binary with `gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`; `Dockerfile` provides a minimal production container using Debian's compiler toolchain.
- The frontend intentionally avoids JavaScript. Standard HTML forms POST to the C server and receive a complete, server-rendered result, keeping the core product in C and making the interaction usable with keyboard navigation and scripts disabled.

## Design direction

### Three possible styles

- **Quiet editorial ledger** — 0.06: warm paper, ink, and one bright savings accent with asymmetrical information blocks.
- **Neo-bank glass** — 0.07: cool gradients, translucent cards, and dense app chrome.
- **Civic utility** — 0.04: high-contrast navy, orange, and structured public-service forms.

### Chosen style: Quiet editorial ledger

- **Design Movement:** Contemporary editorial finance tools, borrowing the calm hierarchy of a well-made annual report rather than a fintech trading screen.
- **Core Principles:** Make the numbers legible; keep every recommendation explainable; reduce financial shame; make privacy visible.
- **Color Philosophy:** A soft parchment background lowers visual stress, deep ink anchors reading, sage signals stability, and a single citrus accent marks action without implying guaranteed outcomes.
- **Layout Paradigm:** A left rail establishes the “ledger” identity while the main column moves from inputs to snapshot to conversation; wide budget cards alternate with narrow notes so the page does not feel like a centered grid.
- **Signature Elements:** A vertical “C” mark in the brand rail, pill-shaped metric labels, and thin ruled dividers that echo a paper ledger.
- **Interaction Philosophy:** Inputs are plain and explicit; results appear in familiar money language; every recommendation includes a “why this appears” explanation.
- **Animation:** No required motion. Preserve a stable layout for reduced-motion users and keep form feedback immediate through normal server responses.
- **Typography System:** Use Georgia for the display wordmark and headings, with system sans-serif for labels, controls, and metric values. Large headings are compact; body copy stays at a comfortable reading width.
- **Brand Essence:** “A calmer first conversation with your money” for people who want a useful starting point without handing over their accounts; thoughtful, grounded, encouraging.
- **Brand Voice:** Headlines are direct and humane. Example lines: “See what your month can carry.” / “Start with the next useful move.”
- **Wordmark & Logo:** A stacked “C / S” ledger monogram inside a narrow rounded rectangle beside the Centsage wordmark.
- **Signature Brand Color:** Citrus chartreuse `#d9ef72`, used sparingly for the primary action and the “breathing room” indicator.

## Constraints and safeguards

The experience will clearly say it is educational and not licensed financial advice. It will not make investment, tax, insurance, lending, or guaranteed-return claims. Calculations use simple monthly arithmetic and show their assumptions in plain language. The server does not persist submitted financial values.
